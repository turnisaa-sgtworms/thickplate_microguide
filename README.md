# thickplate_microguide
a super quick guide for making thick plates.

starting with a dxf of your plate, import it into fusion, then open it and edit the sketch.
![edit the sketch](https://github.com/turnisaa-sgtworms/thickplate_microguide/blob/main/images/edit%20sketch.png?raw=true)

add cutouts to one switch, i used 1mm by 2.5mm but used a center rectangle for ease of drawing. in the next image you'll see i trimmed out the extra lines in the square BUT NOT ALL OF THEM. in hindsight, i also should have waited to add these until after the first extrude, as if you do it this way you have to suffer and select every single little extra piece for the first extrude.

copy and paste this cutout to every switch - you can also use rectangular patterns for areas of switches that are regularly spaced.

make a big cutout for any area you will have a stabilizer. notice i also seperated the mounting area so that it will be the correct thickness.
![make sure you leave a big area anywhere youll be using stabilizers](https://github.com/turnisaa-sgtworms/thickplate_microguide/blob/main/images/stab%20border.png?raw=true)

extrude the ENTIRE plate up 1.5mm. at this point you effectively have a regular plate with some hidden sketch junk we're about to use
![extrude ALL of the plate up](https://github.com/turnisaa-sgtworms/thickplate_microguide/blob/main/images/extrude%20ALL%20up.png?raw=true)

unhide the sketch and extrude the plate MINUS the cutouts down 3.4mm (3.5 minus tolerance to be sure it fits)
![extrude the plate minus the cutouts down](https://github.com/turnisaa-sgtworms/thickplate_microguide/blob/main/images/extrude%20SOME%20down.png?raw=true)

done! export in whatever file type and get slicing :D
